# KB-Corruptor-Tool
 
A tool that 'corrupts' your levels by changing all of the color channels, triggers, and objects to look like the Geometry Dash level "Killbot".

## Download Executable
[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l0zoqzdbfna7iyl/killbot.exe?dl=1) is a direct download of the tool as an Executable.

## Installation
This requires Python 3.7 or higher.
Make sure you also have the Python modules `psutil` and `pillow`.
To install it, open a **Command Prompt** and type these commands:
```
pip install psutil
```
```
pip install pillow
```

To run the program, simply run `main.py` with the command:
```
python3 main.py
```

## Usage
Have the level you want corrupted on the top of your Created Levels list.
**WARNING**: You can't uncorrupt a level, make sure you're absolutely sure when you willingly corrupt a level.
Close Geometry Dash before you run the tool.
Run the tool, verify it's the correct level, and type 'yes'. The tool is good to close once the animation starts playing.
